# Online Amicable Form
Proiect CodersLab

This project was started durring the classes I follwed at CodersLab. 

My application idea came after I realized in Romania you don't have the posibility, in case of a small car accident, to complete the Amicable Form online and send it to insurance companies. This way, time and pappers could be saved for both sides, people and companies.

With this app, I want people be capable to create an account based on their vehicule number, log in, complete the form, upload their documents, and send it directly to insurance companies, without the need to go phisically there and complete tons of papers. 

#technologies used

The app was developed in ReactJS. 
I also used:
HTML, CSS/SCSS,RWD, EcmaScript6
NPM, BABEL, WEBPACK, GULP

It's all about making people's life easier :)
